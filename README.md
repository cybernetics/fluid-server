You shouldn't use this. Work in progress :)

If you use Gradle composite builds and some dependencies don't resolve then disable the option `Create separate module per source set` in IntelliJ IDEA.
See [IDEA-205023](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-205023) and [IDEA-181187](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-181187).
